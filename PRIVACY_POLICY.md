**Privacy Policy**

1. Data Collected
   Only data that is necessary for the bot’s functionality is collected and stored. This includes information you provide through bot commands that are essential for the bot to work (e.g., custom words, personal settings). No additional personal information beyond your Discord username and ID, as provided by Discord, is collected.

   - Data is retained only as long as necessary for the bot’s functionality or as required by law.
   - We only collect the minimum data required to provide the bot’s features. No additional personal information is stored.
   - The bot does not read or store any messages except those directly used in commands or interactions. It does not have access to message content outside these contexts.
   - You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you, as well as request deletion of your data at any time by contacting our support server.
     
   What personal data is stored exactly:
   - Discord User ID (used to identify users)
   - /button User highscore (number of button presses per user)

2. **Purpose of Data Use**
   Collected data is used solely to operate and improve the bot’s features, such as saving game states or user-specific settings.

3. **Third-Party Data Usage**
   The bot uses public APIs like Reddit to fetch and display content (e.g., memes). No personal user data is shared with these third parties.

4. **Data Sharing**
   Your data will never be sold or shared with third parties, except when required by law.

5. **Data Security**
   Reasonable technical and organizational measures are implemented to protect your data from unauthorized access.

6. **Changes to Privacy Policy**
   This policy may be updated or changed at any time without prior notice. Users are encouraged to check the latest version in the repository or via the bot’s support server.
